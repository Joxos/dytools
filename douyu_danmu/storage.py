"""Abstract base class for pluggable danmu message storage implementations.

This module defines the StorageHandler interface that all concrete storage
implementations must follow. It provides a standardized way to save danmu messages
to different backends (CSV, database, cloud storage, etc.) with automatic resource
cleanup via the context manager protocol.

Classes:
    StorageHandler: Abstract base class defining the storage interface.

Usage Example:
    ```python
    from douyu_danmu import DanmuMessage
    from douyu_danmu.storage import StorageHandler

    class FileStorage(StorageHandler):
        '''Custom storage that appends messages to a file.'''

        def __init__(self, filepath):
            self.filepath = filepath
            self.file = open(filepath, 'w')

        def save(self, message: DanmuMessage) -> None:
            self.file.write(f"{message.username}: {message.content}\\n")

        def close(self) -> None:
            self.file.close()

    # Usage with context manager (automatic cleanup)
    with FileStorage('messages.txt') as storage:
        storage.save(some_message)
        storage.save(another_message)
        # File automatically closed when exiting 'with' block
    ```

Design Notes:
    - All subclasses MUST implement save() and close() methods
    - Use the context manager protocol (__enter__/__exit__) for resource management
    - Storage handlers should be tolerant of concurrent calls and edge cases
    - The save() method receives complete DanmuMessage objects with all fields set

    This class defines the interface that all concrete storage implementations

    Methods:
        save(message): Persist a single danmu message to storage.
        close(): Finalize storage and release any held resources.

    Context Manager Protocol:
        StorageHandler supports Python's context manager protocol, enabling
        use with 'with' statements for automatic resource cleanup.

    Example:
        ```python
        with MyCustomStorage(config) as storage:
            for message in collector.messages:
                storage.save(message)
