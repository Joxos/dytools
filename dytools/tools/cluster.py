"""Clustering analysis for danmu messages — "R&D chains".

Groups similar (but not identical) danmu messages into clusters using greedy
pair-wise comparison with difflib.SequenceMatcher. Queries message data from
PostgreSQL database. Only clusters with 2+ variants are reported, making them
useful for identifying promotional spam or coordinated copy-paste variants.

Functions:
    cluster(dsn, room_id, threshold, msg_type, limit) -> list: Query DB and cluster

CSV Output Format (when -o specified):
    5 columns: cluster_id, variant_rank, count, content, similarity_to_top
    - cluster_id: 1-based integer cluster identifier
    - variant_rank: 1-based rank within cluster (1 = highest frequency)
    - count: Number of occurrences of this variant
    - content: The message text
    - similarity_to_top: SequenceMatcher ratio vs. cluster's top variant (1.0 for top)

    For each unassigned message, either assign it to the first cluster whose

    Performance optimisation: skip SequenceMatcher if the length ratio between
    the two strings is more than 3x — they cannot possibly score >= threshold
    for reasonable threshold values, and it avoids wasting CPU on very long /
    very short string pairs.
