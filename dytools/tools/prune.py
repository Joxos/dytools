"""Tool for deduplicating danmaku records in PostgreSQL database.

This tool provides functionality to:
- Connect to PostgreSQL database via DSN
- Identify duplicate danmaku records based on (room_id, timestamp, user_id, content)
- Remove duplicates while keeping the most recent record (MAX id)
- Support efficient SQL-based deduplication using CTE and window functions

Usage:
    python -m dytools prune --dsn "postgresql://..." --room 6657
